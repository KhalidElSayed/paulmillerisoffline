The code in this project is dual-licensed, albeit under a pair of compatible licenses. 

Firstly it is available under the GNU General Public License version 3 ("GPLv3"), with the "or any later version" clause. A copy of the GPL is available in this source repository.

The code is also exlicitly licensed under copyleft-next 0.2.1 or later. Although in principle this shouldn't matter since copyleft-next is GPL compatible, it seemed reasonable to explicitly dual-license.

Note that this is merely the code; anything involving Paul Miller or his employer may well fall under other legal terms.

Furthermore, the background and app icon images used were created by [The Verge user Andrew Rockefeller](http://www.theverge.com/users/Andrew%20Rockefeller) who has stated [he is ok with people using the images](http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/24/4141110/a-paul-offline-app-for-windows-phone#152134891)
