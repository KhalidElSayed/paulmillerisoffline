Paul Miller Is Offline
===================

Android App; countdown to the end of Verge editor Paul Miller's self-imposed exile from the internet.

## Google Play

Turns out any old schmuck can go publish stuff on Google Play, as evidenced by https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ca.keithzg.paulmiller.is.offline

## Licence / License

The code in this project is dual-licensed, albeit under a pair of compatible licenses. 

Firstly it is available under the GNU General Public License version 3 ("GPLv3"), with the "or later" clause. A copy of the GPL is available in this source repository.

The code is also exlicitly licensed under copyleft-next 0.2.0 or later. Although in principle this shouldn't matter since copyleft-next is GPL compatible, it seemed reasonable to explicitly dual-license. 

Note that this is merely the code; anything involving Paul Miller or his employer may well fall under other legal terms.

Furthermore, the images used were created by http://www.theverge.com/users/Andrew%20Rockefeller and so things get murky along those lines too.
